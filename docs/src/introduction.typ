= Introduction
Building Rust for RISC-V in a bare-metal environment requires a clear understanding of the necessary configurations, toolchains, and runtime considerations. This document provides an overview of key aspects involved in setting up Rust for RISC-V without an operating system and in combination with RTEMS, a real-time operating system.

Rather than serving as a step-by-step tutorial, this document outlines:

- Essential configurations required to compile Rust for RISC-V.
- Target specifications and toolchain setup for bare-metal execution.
- Memory management and allocator considerations in no_std environments.
- QEMU as a simulation platform for RISC-V targets.
- RTEMS integration, including BSP selection and linking Rust with RTEMS libraries.

By exploring these topics, this document aims to provide a high-level understanding of what is required to build and run Rust in these environments.
